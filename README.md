# Billable Hours Calculator

**The hours calculator was developed and made available through my old company, [Prelimine](https://www.prelimine.com).
This repo is a fork from the [business account](https://github.com/Prelimine-JF/HoursCalculator) as the business was sunset.**

Currently, there is a [live version](https://prelimine-hours.netlify.app) that uses `localStorage` for data persistence.
